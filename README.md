# Report-Card
I am looking to see if there is anyone available to create a computerized report card program. This is for a highschool to keep things more efficient. 

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.txt

## Deliverables 
The 3 files listed below are required to be implemented for this repo. The info for each one is included in the spec.
1. table.sql (create database and table)
2. sampledata.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as appropriate
- appropriate constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
